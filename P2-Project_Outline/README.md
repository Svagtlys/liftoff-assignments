# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Want to track how often you do or don't do things? Want to be reminded of things you need to do, but Google reminders don't go off, and normal alarms are too limiting? <APPLICATION> is designed to help you become the best you, through alarms, habit-tracking, and a reward system that you design yourself.

<APPLICATION> allows you to set how often you want to do a habit, and when you'd like check-ins throughout the week or month on how you're doing. You can also set alarms for specific times of day, days of the month, and recurring alarms, to help you set a stable routine which will lead to a happier, healthier you. The best part is that, if your life changes dramatically, you can turn off or move multiple alarms/reminders at once, so that you can set aside certain routines with little hassle while you deal with what's most important: the here and now.
### Features
1. Alarms - Create, remove, snooze, and edit alarms, to start with
2. Point tracking and redemption - Track how many points the user has earned based on what tasks they've completed and routines they've kept, and allow the user to create rewards and set prices so they can redeem their points for things they want to treat themself with.
3. Alarm Routines - Group alarms together to create routines, which can be used to move all the alarms within them at once, as well as turn them all off, without going to the individual alarms
4. Habits - These are things the person wants to do x times per day/week/month, but not at any specific time, though alarms can be added through these habits to remind the user at a specific time that they should do it. At the end of the day, the user will be reminded to check off completed habits, and gain points for doing so.
### Technologies
- Java
- Android Studio
### What I'll Have to Learn
I've kind of used Android Studio before (made a very small madlib app) but I'll have to learn a lot more features to be able to build an alarm app (I tried and failed a while back)
